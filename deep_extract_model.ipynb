Testing included System Integration Testing, Regression Testing, GUI Testing and Reports.  Responsibilities-  Automation work • Preparing automation scripts using HP UFT tool where focus on Middleware logging as per the ESB behavior. • Integrating all automation scripts with the ALM so that on one click we are able to execute test cases and collecting all test results and logged defects in ALM without any manual efforts. Manual Work -    • Requirement analysis and Test Planning. • Test Scenarios preparation for various functionalities as per the Requirement. • Test Cases Creation and their execution for various functionalities of ESB and different provider services • Prioritization of test cases as per the business requirement • Test Data Preparation as per the requirement using HP ALM. • Defect logging in case of any unusual behavior of the solution. • Preparing Weekly Progress Reports. • Leading the defect call • Virtualizing services using HP SV tool and deploy on central server so that in downtime testing should not be impacted. CICD-JENKINS: • Involve in Continuous integration and continuous deployment strategy, with the help of JENKINS & UFT (automation scri pt integrated with HP ALM) successfully implemented for currently working project.  TDM implantation in CICD pipeline.  Presentation - Direct communication to clients: • Present my team and our work to the client directly. (including CICD and TDM job implementation in the same)  uiPath exposure within same project: • Convert existing/new projects which are using UFT for automation into uiPath based automation. • Do the feasibility analysis for the conversion and come up with a plan to convert maximum artifacts with minimum efforts • Setup basic skeleton for the new project\n",
